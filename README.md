# ANN_Research_Project
A research project for the course Artificial Neural Networks

This repository hosts a project for the ANN course. The project focuses on the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
to reconstruct blood flow fields from limited and noisy datasets, a crucial task in scenarios where high-quality blood flow measurements
are hindered by low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). The objective of this project is to merge available noisy data with fundamental physical
principles, reconstructing the flow field and the boundary shape using the capabilities of PINNs.
