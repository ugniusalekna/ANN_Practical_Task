# Blood flow reconstruction using PINNs
A research project for the course Artificial Neural Networks

This repository hosts a project for the ANN course. The project focuses on the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
to reconstruct blood flow fields from limited and noisy datasets, which is useful, when high-quality blood flow measurements
are hindered by low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). The objective of this project is to merge available noisy data with physical
principles, reconstructing the flow field using PINNs.
